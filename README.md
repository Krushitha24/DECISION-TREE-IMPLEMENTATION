# This project focuses on using a Decision Tree model to predict whether a customer will subscribe to a term deposit as part of a bank’s marketing campaign. The dataset contains information about each customer, such as their age, job, marital status, education, and previous interactions with the bank. The goal is to use this information to predict the customer's response—either "yes" or "no"—to the offer. The implementation is done using Python, with the help of popular libraries like Pandas for data handling, NumPy for numerical operations, Matplotlib and Seaborn for visualization, and Scikit-learn for building and evaluating the machine learning model. The process starts by loading and exploring the dataset to understand the types of data and identify any missing or categorical values. These values are then cleaned and converted into a numerical format suitable for machine learning. The data is split into training and testing sets to build and evaluate the model properly.

# A Decision Tree Classifier is then created using Scikit-learn. This model works like a flowchart, where each decision is based on one of the customer’s features, leading to a final prediction. After training the model with the training data, it is tested on the unseen test data to evaluate its performance. Metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score are used to measure how well the model predicts customer responses. A confusion matrix is also used to get a clearer view of correct and incorrect predictions. To improve the model, parameters like the tree depth and splitting method are adjusted to prevent overfitting or underfitting. Finally, the decision tree is visualized to better understand how the model makes decisions, and the importance of each feature is analyzed to see which customer details most influenced the predictions. Overall, the notebook shows how a Decision Tree can help banks make smarter marketing decisions by targeting customers who are more likely to respond positively to their offers.
